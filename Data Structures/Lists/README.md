[Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) | In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. | [C](https://github.com/eduardoparaiso/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/Data%20Structures/Lists/Linked%20List/linked_list.c)
