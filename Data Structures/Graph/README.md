[Adjacency List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) | In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph. This is one of several commonly used representations of graphs for use in computer programs. | [C](https://github.com/eduardoparaiso/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/Data%20Structures/Graph/Adjacency%20List/adjacency_list.c)
[Adjacency Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) | In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. | [C](https://github.com/eduardoparaiso/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/Data%20Structures/Graph/Adjacency%20Matrix/adjacency_matrix.c)
