[Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) | Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. | [C]() <br> [Java]() <br> [Python]()
